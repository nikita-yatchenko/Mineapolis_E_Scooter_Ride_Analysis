Are there patterns in average number of electric scooter rides and the destination choice throughout a day in Minneapolis, Minnesota? 

Sub questions: When do we expect the number of rides to decrease and when do we expect to see it increase? 
Is there, generally, a hub for end destination? If yes, how does this hub change throughout the day?


Analysis took place over the September through October time frame. Additionally, we added data that translated destination code to the 
street intersection. After analysing these data we can clearly see that there are clear patterns of how citizens of Minneapolis use 
e-scooters. First, the riding activity starts very early in the morning. People get rides all night, but the activity is low, 
and starts to accelerate atound 7am, then continues to increase but at a slower rate. Rides reach their peak at 5pm and proceed
to decline, hitting rock bottom at around 11pm. 
Most common destination is 14th Ave SE and 5th St SE - a university of minnesota is located right near this corner, suggesting
that this is one of the most popular places people go at the end of the day. Additionally, if you could click through the graphic,
you would see that another most common place for people to go in the morning is downtown. It makes sense since that's where the
majority of business is happening.
