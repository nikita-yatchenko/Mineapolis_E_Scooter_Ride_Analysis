Are there patterns in average number of electric scooter rides and the destination choice throughout a day in Minneapolis, Minnesota? 

Sub questions: When do we expect the number of rides to decrease and when do we expect to see it increase? 
Is there, generally, a hub for end destination? If yes, how does this hub change throughout the day?


Analysis took place over the September through October time frame. Additionally, we added data that translated destination code to the 
street intersection. After analysing these data we can clearly see that there are clear patterns of how citizens of Minneapolis use e-scooters.
First, the activity dies down around 3:30am and picks back up around 10am. Please note
